## Project Description

The HP Data Quality team is tasked with moving large amounts of data on a regular basis.  They would like to development an Extract Transform and Load tool that allows them to move file and relational data on a regular basis and create a monitoring service which can display the status of the currently scheduled and recently completed jobs.  Often they are moving data between regular and HDFS file systems.
