
Question 1.1.3
"I don't see how audit related fields are populated in entities. It looks like front end should do this using the current user information."
In controller update and create methods new notes were added.


Question 1.1.4
"Minor, JobServiceImpl.resumeJobExecution - no need for CronTrigger, you could just use SimpleTrigger."
Fixed.

"TransformationJob.execute:
Long jobExecutionStatusId = data.getLong(JOB_EXECUTION_STATUS_ID_KEY);"
Fixed.
